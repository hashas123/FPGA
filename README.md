This repository includes a collection of digital design projects developed in VHDL and SystemVerilog.

The projects cover both fundamental and system-level digital design concepts.  
Basic designs include:
- 1-bit and 2-bit comparators
- Half Adder and Full Adder implementations
- 1-to-2 and 2-to-4 decoders
- Carry Ripple Adder(N-bit)

More advanced designs focus on specific architectural topics, such as:
- A four-way highway traffic controller based on a finite state machine (FSM) and a clock divider
  (system clock to 1 Hz)
- A 32-bit RAM architecture

VHDL-based testbenches are provided for several modules to support functional verification.
