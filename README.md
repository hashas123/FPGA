This repository contains a collection of digital design projects developed using VHDL and SystemVerilog.

The projects span both fundamental and system-level digital design concepts.

Basic digital design modules include:
- 1-bit and 2-bit comparators
- Half Adder and Full Adder implementations
- 1-to-2 and 2-to-4 decoders
- Parameterized N-bit Carry Ripple Adder

More advanced designs focus on architectural and system-oriented topics, including:
- A four-way highway traffic controller implemented using a finite state machine (FSM) and a clock divider (system clock to 1 Hz)
- A 32-bit RAM architecture

VHDL-based testbenches are provided for several modules to support functional verification and simulation.
